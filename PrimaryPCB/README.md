# Project Structure

## BOM (Bill Of Material)

The BOM folder contains two different BOMs. First is a standard bill of material and contains an itemized list of the parts used in the project. 

A second BOM call iBOM (interactive BOM) is included that can be used to help find part placement during assembly.

## Documentation

## Gerbers

Contains a zip file that can be used for ordering the PCB from a manufacturer.
